# Project Proposal Repository

Welcome to the Project Proposal Repository! This repository is dedicated to collecting and managing project proposals for our organization/community. If you have a project idea or proposal, feel free to submit it here.

## How to Submit a Proposal
Use the Typeform in `#bl-project_ideas` slack channel in our community to make a project proposal. We will take care of the rest!

## Open Proposals
At any time you can take a look at the submitted proposals, their current status and associated discussion via [this overview](https://github.com/TechLabs-Berlin/project_proposals/issues). 

We are using GitHub issues to manage this entire process.
